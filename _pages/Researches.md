  <div class="project-title">🦠 Rationally Designed Consortia (RDC) to Prevent C. difficile Infection</div>

  <p>
  The gut microbiome is a competitive ecosystem where timing, nutrient availability, and community structure shape colonization success. Our group engineered a Rationally Designed Consortium (RDC)—a defined, sequenced, and highly cohesive microbial community developed in prebiotic-fed bioreactors.
  </p>

  <p>
  Aging disrupts intestinal barrier integrity and weakens colonization resistance, increasing susceptibility to <i>C. difficile</i> infection (CDI). We found that GOS and hGOS create nutritional niches that enhance RDC persistence while suppressing <i>C. difficile</i> growth. In mouse models, GOS + RDC significantly reduced pathogen burden.

  <p><b>Key goals:</b></p>

  - Test synbiotic (GOS/hGOS + RDC) protection across age groups  
  - Determine how prebiotics reshape microbial competition and nutrient use  
  - Develop mechanistic foundations for next-generation synbiotics for CDI prevention

  <div class="project-title">🧬 Prebiotic-Driven Dynamics of <i>Lactobacillus</i> Co-Cultures</div>

  <p>
  Probiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> interact dynamically within microbial communities. 
  We examined how different carbohydrates—glucose, lactose, GOS, and our humanized GOS (hGOS)—shape the growth and competition of three fluorescently labeled strains: <b>LGG</b>, <b>AMC143</b>, and <b>L. plantarum</b> (Lp).
  </p>

  <p>
  Lp dominated co-cultures with fast growth rates in GOS and hGOS, while LGG and AMC143 grew more slowly. hGOS uniquely induced nagB upregulation in LGG, improving tolerance to lysozyme and mechanical stress. 
  These results reveal carbohydrate-specific competitive advantages and stress responses.
  </p>

  <p><b>Implications:</b></p>

  - Strain-specific metabolism influences fitness in co-culture  
  - These insights guide synbiotic design for targeted microbial modulation

  <div class="project-title">🧫 How Prebiotics Remodel Intestinal Mucus</div>

  <p>
  The colonic mucus layer forms a critical barrier that separates microbes from the epithelium. Aging reduces mucus thickness and alters glycan composition, contributing to inflammation and pathogen vulnerability.
  </p>

  <p>
  We study how GOS and hGOS regulate Muc2 production, mucus architecture, and O-glycan profiles using both in vitro (HT29-MTX, primary monolayers) and in vivo mouse models. 
  Our work aims to determine how prebiotics enhance barrier integrity and facilitate beneficial bacteria colonization.
  </p>

  <p><b>Focus areas:</b></p>

  - Quantification of mucus secretion
  - Changes in O-glycan motifs supporting beneficial adhesion
  - Mucus–microbiota spatial organization (histology + FISH)
