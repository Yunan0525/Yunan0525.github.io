## 🦠 Rationally Designed Consortia (RDC) to Prevent *C. difficile* Infection {#rdc}

<div class="project-title">Rationally Designed Consortia (RDC) to Prevent <i>C. difficile</i> Infection</div>

<p>
The gut microbiome is a competitive ecosystem where timing, nutrient availability, and community structure shape colonization success. Our group engineered a Rationally Designed Consortium (RDC)—a defined, sequenced, and highly cohesive microbial community developed in prebiotic-fed bioreactors.
</p>

<p>
Aging disrupts intestinal barrier integrity and weakens colonization resistance, increasing susceptibility to <i>C. difficile</i> infection (CDI). We found that GOS and hGOS create nutritional niches that enhance RDC persistence while suppressing <i>C. difficile</i> growth. In mouse models, GOS + RDC significantly reduced pathogen burden.
</p>

<p><b>Key goals:</b></p>

- Test synbiotic (GOS/hGOS + RDC) protection across age groups  
- Determine how prebiotics reshape microbial competition and nutrient use  
- Develop mechanistic foundations for next-generation synbiotics for CDI prevention

## 🧬 Prebiotic-Driven Dynamics of *Lactobacillus* Co-Cultures {#lacto}

<div class="project-title">Prebiotic-Driven Dynamics of <i>Lactobacillus</i> Co-Cultures</div>

<p>
Probiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> interact dynamically within microbial communities. 
We examined how different carbohydrates—glucose, lactose, GOS, and our humanized GOS (hGOS)—shape the growth and competition of three fluorescently labeled strains: <b>LGG</b>, <b>AMC143</b>, and <b>L. plantarum</b> (Lp).
</p>

<p>
Lp dominated co-cultures with fast growth rates in GOS and hGOS, while LGG and AMC143 grew more slowly. hGOS uniquely induced <i>nagB</i> upregulation in LGG, improving tolerance to lysozyme and mechanical stress. 
These results reveal carbohydrate-specific competitive advantages and stress responses.
</p>

<p><b>Implications:</b></p>

- Strain-specific metabolism influences fitness in co-culture  
- These insights guide synbiotic design for targeted microbial modulation

## 🧫 How Prebiotics Remodel Intestinal Mucus {#mucus}

<div class="project-section">

<div class="project-title">How Prebiotics Remodel Intestinal Mucus</div>

<p>
The colonic mucus layer forms a critical barrier that separates microbes from the epithelium. Aging reduces mucus thickness and alters glycan composition, contributing to inflammation and pathogen vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
We study how GOS and hGOS regulate Muc2 production, mucus architecture, and O-glycan profiles using both in vitro (HT29-MTX, primary monolayers) and in vivo mouse models. 
Our work aims to determine how prebiotics enhance barrier integrity and facilitate beneficial bacteria colonization.
</p>

<p><b>Focus areas:</b></p>

- Quantification of mucus secretion  
- Changes in O-glycan motifs supporting beneficial adhesion  
- Mucus–microbiota spatial organization (histology + FISH)
